# Scattered Pics

### What is it?
Beauty from chaos. This piece is supposed to resemble dropping photos on the ground to see where they land. Photos are rotated, overlaped, and in random locations. After the photos 'fall' on the page you can drag them around, 'pick them up' (remove them), shuffle them around, and add more to the mess (via url or file upload). 

### How does it work?
Simply got to https://mjmartinson.github.io/netart/ and you will see a scatter of random nature pictures 'fall' onto the page. Then there are buttons at the top:

 * Upload Photo: Add a photo to the mess from your local computer
 * Upload Url: Add a photo to the mess with a url to a photo on the internet
 * Remove Mode: Enter remove mode where you click on photos to delete them. 
   * Normal Mode: The remove mode button becomes this button when you are in remove mode. Remember to press this button when you are done removing pictures so you can drag them around again.
 * Shuffle!: Shuffle all the photos on the page into new locations and rotations

### Future Plans 
The original idea for this project was slightly different and better equipped for digital gardening. The idea was to start with a blank page and anyone can upload their photos to add to the page. Therefore the page would start empty and grow as people add to the page. This has great potential for digital gardening. This is only possible by being able to presist these images on a backend server so it was outside the scope of the current iteration of this project. The next step for this project will be to create a backend that will persist uploaded images.
